So this is just us, having a conversation about games, that we've actually recorded.' So put down the controller, step away from the keyboard, give your ears some love and take a break with Ben and Tao's leftfield video game analysis, fresh from the screen.">

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
